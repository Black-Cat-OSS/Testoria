if the c# programming language is used, pay attention to the following aspects:
- if no inheritance is planned from the class or is not explicitly defined, add sealed
- if a Data Transfer Object is created, then make it readonly so that it cannot be changed after initialization

Audit existing entities, maybe the necessary fields or methods have already been implemented somewhere and OOP principles can be applied in this class.: Polymorphism, Inheritance, And Encapsulation.

Don't forget about the LSP principle and apply it if necessary if entities have similar features, attributes, methods, and other operands.
