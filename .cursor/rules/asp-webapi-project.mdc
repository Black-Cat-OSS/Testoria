when creating a module, the main thing is to properly distribute the entities into directories. Below is an example of what the module structure should be:

(ModuleName)Module
+- Interfaces
+-- I(InterfaceName).cs
+- DTO
+-- (ObjectName)DTO.cs
+- Controllers
+-- (ControllerName)Controller.cs
+- Services
+-- (ServiceName)Service.cs
+- Exceptions
+-- (ExceptionName)Exception.cs
+- Extensions
+-- (ExtensionName)Extension.cs
+- Events
+-- (EventName)Event.cs
