don't use comments in the code. Use better documentation management provided for a particular programming language.

Eg:
- Javascript and TypeScript use jsDocs.
- Use xml documentation in C#.
- OpenAPI Swagger use yaml/json documentation (as a rule, it is generated by a separate script)

In all other cases, comments are not acceptable.
